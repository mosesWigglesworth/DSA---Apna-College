# #1. 🌟 What Are Flowcharts?

Flowcharts are **visual diagrams** that represent the **solution of a problem** using **logical steps** in a **structured format**.

---

## 🧠 Why Learn Flowcharts?

> If you already know basic coding (like `if-else`, `variables`, etc.), this topic may seem optional — but flowcharts **train your mind** to think logically before coding.

✅ You **don’t need a laptop**.
✍️ Just a **pen and paper** is enough to practice.
📈 It improves **problem-solving** & **algorithmic thinking**.

## 🧩 Flowcharts Help You:

| 🔍 Problem                  | 🪄 Think Logically          | 📊 Draw Diagram                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Understand a real-life task | Break it into smaller steps | Represent it using shapes and arrows |

# 🔄 Flowchart Structure: Step-by-Step

Let’s understand this with a **real-life example**:
👉 **"How to Make Tea"**

We’ll break it into **logical steps** and show how they translate into a flowchart.

## 🫖 Making Tea – Logical Steps

| 🔢 Step | 🧩 Action                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣     | **Start**                       |
| 2️⃣     | Take a **bowl (patila)**        |
| 3️⃣     | Add **water**                   |
| 4️⃣     | Turn **ON the gas stove**       |
| 5️⃣     | Add **tea leaves, sugar, milk** |

## 📌 Flowchart Symbols (with Icons)

| Symbol            | Meaning          | Icon                |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| 🔷 **Terminator** | Start / End      | `Start` / `End`     |
| ⬛ **Process**     | Action / Task    | `Add Water`         |
| 🔷 **Decision**   | Yes/No or Choice | `Is water boiling?` |
| ➡️ **Arrow**      | Flow of logic    | Connects steps      |

---

## 📋 Flowchart for "Making Tea"

Here's how we translate the logic above into a **flowchart**:

```
🔷 Start
  |
⬛ Take a bowl
  |
⬛ Add water
  |
⬛ Turn ON gas stove
  |
⬛ Add tea leaves, sugar, milk
  |
⬛ Boil the mixture
  |
⬛ Turn OFF gas
  |
🔷 End (Tea is ready!)
```

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings:

✅ **Break down** big problems into smaller steps
✅ **Arrange them logically** (which action comes first?)
✅ Use **flowcharts** to **visualize the solution** before coding
✅ Helps in both **interviews** and **coding problem-solving**

---

## 💡 Activity Tip:

> After watching or reading a problem, **pause**, and try drawing the flowchart **on your own**.
> Then, compare with the official one to see how close your logic was. This builds confidence and clarity!

## 🔁 Final Thoughts

**Flowcharts = Structured Thinking + Visual Logic**

Whether you’re a beginner or experienced coder, flowcharts are your **thinking playground** before touching the keyboard.

---

# #2. 🧱 Flowchart Components – The Building Blocks of Logic

Before creating a flowchart, we must understand the **shapes** or **symbols** used in it. Each shape has a **specific meaning**, just like words in a sentence!

These are **not random drawings** like animals or trees in science books — these are **logical diagram symbols**.

---

## 🧠 Why are Components Important?

✔️ They **standardize** how flowcharts are understood
✔️ They make **complex logic easier** to represent
✔️ Each component has a **unique role** in solving problems visually

---

# 🔹 1. Terminator Shape – OVAL 🔷

### 📌 Used For:

* **Start** of the process
* **End** (Exit) of the process

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔷 Start
🔷 Exit
```

### ✅ Real Example:

| 🫖 Tea Making      | 🔠 Programming |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| "Start making tea" | Start of code  |
| "Tea is ready!"    | End/Exit point |

---

# 🔸 2. Input/Output Shape – PARALLELOGRAM 🔶

### 📌 Used For:

* **Input** (user enters something)
* **Output** (program gives something back)

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔶 Input: Enter temperature
🔶 Output: Print "Hello"
```

### 🧪 Tea Example:

* 🥄 Input: Add **milk, sugar, tea leaves** (controlled by the user)
* ☕ Output: Final **ready tea**

### 🌍 Real-World Example – Google Search:

| 🧑 User Types          | Google Responds                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Input: `"cat meaning"` | Output: `"a small domesticated animal"` |

---

# 🟩 3. Process Shape – RECTANGLE ⬛

### 📌 Used For:

* Any **processing step**
* Assigning values
* Performing calculations

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
⬛ A = 10
⬛ Sum = A + B
⬛ Name = "Shraddha"
```

### 🔧 Common Use Cases:

* Assign a value to a variable
* Do calculations (e.g., `total = price * qty`)
* Execute any operation

---

# 💠 4. Decision Shape – DIAMOND 🔷

### 📌 Used For:

* **Conditional Checks**
* Yes/No, True/False decisions
* **Branching** logic

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔷 Is Marks > 33?
     /       \
  Yes         No
 /             \
⬛ Pass        ⬛ Fail
```

### 🌿 Real-Life Analogy:

> Decision = “Branching point of a tree 🌳”
> If condition is **True**, go left.
> If condition is **False**, go right.

---

# ➡️ 5. Arrows – CONNECTORS 🔁

### 📌 Used For:

* Connecting different shapes
* Showing **direction** of logic

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔷 Start
  |
⬛ Do Task
  |
🔷 Decision?
 /     \
Yes     No
```

Without arrows, a flowchart becomes confusing. Think of arrows like **Google Maps directions** for your logic. 🗺️

# #4. ✅ **Problem: Calculate the Simple Interest (SI)**

### 📥 **Inputs:**

* `P` = Principal amount
* `R` = Rate of interest (annual)
* `T` = Time period (in years)

### 📤 **Output:**

* Simple Interest (SI), calculated using the formula:

$$
SI = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$

---

### 🧠 **Logic:**

* Use the formula `SI = (P * R * T) / 100`
* The formula is simple multiplication and division.
* It requires no loops or conditionals.
* Emphasis is on understanding how to take input and apply the formula correctly.

---

### 🧾 **Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
START
INPUT P, R, T
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
PRINT SI
EXIT
```

---

### 🔁 **Flowchart Steps:**

1. **Start** (Oval)
2. **Input P, R, T** (Parallelogram)
3. **Calculate SI = (P \* R \* T) / 100** (Process block)
4. **Print SI** (Parallelogram)
5. **Exit** (Oval)

---

### 💡 Notes:

* In programming languages (like Java), multiplication uses `*` and division uses `/`.
* It’s okay if you don’t remember the formula in an interview—just ask for it and proceed with implementation. You’re judged on logic, not memory.

# #5. 🔢 Problem: **Maximum of Three Numbers**

🎯 **Goal:**
Take **three numbers** as input → Compare them → Print the **largest** one.

| **Process**  | Compare to find the **maximum** number |
| **Output**   | Print the **maximum** value            |

---

## 📋 Sample Example

If:

* A = 10
* B = 15
* C = 4

Then the output is:

```

# #6. 🔍 **Problem: Check if a Number is Prime**

## 🧠 **What is a Prime Number?**

A **prime number** is a number **greater than 1** that has **only two divisors**:

1. **1**
2. **Itself**

✅ Examples:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 (only divisible by 1 and themselves)

❌ Not Prime (Composite):
4 (divisible by 1, 2, 4), 6 (1, 2, 3, 6), 9 (1, 3, 9)

            value++;
        }

        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

## 💡 Alternate Formula (FYI Only)

Instead of looping, this math formula works too:

```
Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
```

But the loop version is great for beginners to understand **iteration** and **flow control**.

# 📈 Flowchart (Text Representation)

```
🔷 Start
   ↓
🔶 Input n
   ↓
⬛ value = 1
⬛ sum = 0
   ↓
🔷 Is value <= n?
  ├── Yes → ⬛ sum = sum + value
  │         ⬛ value = value + 1
  │         ⤴ back to decision
  └── No  → 🔶 Output sum
              ↓
           🔷 Exit
```

## 🧪 Dry Run Example (n = 4)

| value | sum before       | sum after |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1     | 0                | 1         |
| 2     | 1                | 3         |
| 3     | 3                | 6         |
| 4     | 6                | 10        |
| 5     | Stop (value > n) |           |

🟢 Output: `10`
