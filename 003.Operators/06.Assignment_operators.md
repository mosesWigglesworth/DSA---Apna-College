### **Assignment Operators in Java â€“ Clear Explanation**

Assignment operators are used to **store a value** into a variable.
In Java, they can also **update the existing value** in a shorthand way.

---

## âœ… 1. **Basic Assignment (`=`)**

Stores the right-hand side value into the left-hand variable.

```java
int a = 5;  // 'a' now contains 5
```

ðŸ“Œ If `a` already had a value, it gets **replaced**.

---

## âœ… 2. **Compound Assignment Operators**

These combine **arithmetic operation + assignment**.
Instead of writing `a = a + 10`, you can write:

```java
a += 10;   // same as a = a + 10
```

Similarly:

| Operator | Meaning             | Example (`a=10`) | Result |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | `a += 5`         | 15     |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `a -= 3`         | 7      |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `a *= 2`         | 20     |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | `a /= 5`         | 2      |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign  | `a %= 4`         | 2      |

## âš¡ **Why Use Compound Assignment?**

âœ” Cleaner and shorter code
âœ” Executes slightly faster (nanoseconds difference, noticeable in large programs)
âœ” Widely used in **loops, counters, and competitive programming**

---

### **Example:**

```java
int b = 5;

b += 5;  // b = 10
b -= 3;  // b = 7
b *= 2;  // b = 14
b /= 7;  // b = 2
b %= 2;  // b = 0
```
