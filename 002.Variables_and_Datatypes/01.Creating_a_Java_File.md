## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Create a Java File

---

### 📘 1. **What is a Code Editor?**

🧠 **Analogy**:
Just like you solve 📐Math or 🔬Science in a **notebook**, coding is done in a **code editor**.

🖥️ A **Code Editor** is software used to write code.

💡 **Examples of Popular Code Editors**:

* 💙 VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
* 💡 IntelliJ IDEA
* ☕ Eclipse
* 🌐 Online editors (like Replit, JDoodle)

🆓 All these editors are **free of cost**.

### 💻 2. **Choosing VS Code (Visual Studio Code)**

📥 If you’re using **VS Code**, open it.
If you’ve written code before, it may show old files. If it’s new, it’ll be a clean **Welcome screen**.

---

### 📄 3. **Creating a New File**

🔹 Go to: `Start` → Click **New File**
🔹 A blank tab opens.

💾 Now, **Save** the file:

* Press: `Ctrl + S`
* Select: `Desktop`
* Create folder: 📁 `Java Programming Language`
* Name your file: `JavaBasics.java`

---

### 🧩 4. **What is a File Extension?**

🧠 A file extension tells the computer what kind of file it is.

📄 Common extensions:

* Java → `.java`
* C++ → `.cpp`
* Python → `.py`
* HTML → `.html`
* Text → `.txt`

💡 **So, `.java` tells your system + compiler that this file contains Java code.**

✅ **You must always add `.java`** when creating Java source files.

---

### 📁 5. **Check the File Location**

👣 Navigate to:
`This PC → Desktop → Java Programming Language → JavaBasics.java`

📂 You’ll see the file you just saved.

Now, you’re ready to start writing your first Java code in that file!
