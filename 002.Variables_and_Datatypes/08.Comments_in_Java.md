## 📝 What are Comments?

> 🗣️ **Comments are notes for humans, ignored by the computer.**

They **do not affect** how your program runs — they’re just there to explain the code.

---

## 🧠 Why Use Comments?

🧩 Help others (or future you!) understand what your code does
🛠️ Debug or temporarily remove code without deleting it
📖 Add documentation or explanations

---

## ✅ Java Supports Two Types of Comments:

---

### 1️⃣ **Single-Line Comment**

Use `//` to write a comment on one line.

```java
// This line calculates the sum
int sum = a + b;
```

🔍 Anything after `//` is **ignored** by Java.

🖼️ *Think of it like a sticky note beside your code line.*

---

### 2️⃣ **Multi-Line Comment**

Use `/* */` to write a comment across **multiple lines**.

```java
/* 
 This block calculates the sum 
 of two numbers a and b
*/
int sum = a + b;
```

🔍 Everything inside `/* ... */` is **ignored**.

🖼️ *Think of this as a paragraph annotation or a side box.*

## 🧪 Try This in Code:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define two numbers
        int a = 10;
        int b = 5;

        // Calculate the sum of a and b
        int sum = a + b;

        /* 
         Print the result
         Output should be 15
        */
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```

🖨️ **Output:**

```
15
```

## 🚫 Comments Are Ignored by the Compiler

| ✅ This works               | ❌ This causes error                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `// int a = 10;` (ignored) | `int a = 10` (without `;`) ➡️ error |

💡 **Only real code is executed** — not comments!

## 🧩 Summary Table

| Type        | Syntax                | Use For                  |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Single-line | `// comment`          | Short notes, inline tips |
| Multi-line  | `/* comment block */` | Longer explanations      |

## 🔁 When Should You Use Comments?

✅ Explaining logic
✅ Marking sections
✅ Collaborating in teams
✅ Making code readable

> 📌 Good comments = Clean, helpful, and NOT obvious!
