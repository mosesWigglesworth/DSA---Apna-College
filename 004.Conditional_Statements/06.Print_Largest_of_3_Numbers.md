### **"Print the Largest of 3 Numbers" – Crystal Clear Explanation (with Interactive Icons)**

---

#### ✅ 1. **Goal**

We need to **find the largest number** among **three integers** `A`, `B`, and `C`.

---

#### 🧠 2. **Logical Steps**

1. **Compare A with B and C**

   * If `A >= B` **AND** `A >= C` → **A is largest**.

2. **If not, compare B with C**

   * If `B >= C` → **B is largest**.

3. **Else**

   * **C is largest**.

#### 💻 4. **Java Code**

```java
public class LargestOfThree {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 1, b = 3, c = 6;

        if (a >= b && a >= c) {
            System.out.println("Largest is A: " + a);
        } else if (b >= c) {
            System.out.println("Largest is B: " + b);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Largest is C: " + c);
        }
    }
}
```

#### ⚠️ 5. **Key Notes**

* Always use `&&` (logical AND) when checking **two conditions together**.
* `>=` ensures **ties are handled** (e.g., if two numbers are equal, the first one prints as largest).
* The order of checks matters—once a condition is **true**, later checks **don’t execute**.
