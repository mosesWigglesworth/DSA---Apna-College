### **"Print the Largest of 2 Numbers" – Crystal Clear Explanation (with Icons)**

---

#### ✅ 1. **Problem Statement**

We have **two numbers**, `a` and `b`.
We need to **find which one is larger** and print it.

---

#### 🔹 2. **Logic (Step-by-Step)**

1. **Check condition:**
   ➝ Is `a >= b`?

   * ✔ **YES →** `a` is the largest (or equal).
   * ❌ **NO →** `b` is the largest.

2. No need to check the second condition explicitly because `else` handles it.

---

#### 📝 3. **Java Code**

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5;

if (a >= b) {
    System.out.println(a + " is the largest of the two.");
} else {
    System.out.println(b + " is the largest of the two.");
}
```

```
          [ Is a >= b ? ]
               │
        ┌──────┴──────┐
        │             │
      YES           NO
        │             │
  Print a         Print b
```

#### 📌 5. **Example Outputs**

* If `a = 10`, `b = 5` → Output: **"10 is the largest of the two."**
* If `a = 3`, `b = 7` → Output: **"7 is the largest of the two."**
* If `a = 6`, `b = 6` → Output: **"6 is the largest of the two."**

---

#### ⚠️ 6. **Coding Best Practices**

* Even if there’s a **single statement**, prefer **curly braces `{}`** → makes code clean and industry-ready.
* Example:

  ```java
  if (a >= b) {
      System.out.println(a);
  } else {
      System.out.println(b);
  }
  ```
