### **"Income Tax Calculator" – Crystal Clear Explanation (with Icons)**

---

#### ✅ 1. **Goal**

We build a **program** that:

* Takes user's **income**.
* Calculates **tax** based on defined **slabs**.

---

#### 📊 2. **Tax Slabs (Simplified Example)**

|  **Income Range (₹)** | **Tax Rate** |
| --------------------: | -----------: |
|          `< 5,00,000` |         `0%` |
| `5,00,000 – 9,99,999` |        `20%` |
|         `≥ 10,00,000` |        `30%` |

---

#### 📝 3. **Java Code**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class IncomeTaxCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your annual income: ");
        int income = sc.nextInt();
        double tax;

        if (income < 500000) {
            tax = 0;
        } else if (income >= 500000 && income < 1000000) {
            tax = income * 0.2;
        } else {
            tax = income * 0.3;
        }

        System.out.println("Your tax is: ₹" + tax);
    }
}
```

#### 🔄 4. **Logic Flow**

```
[Input income]
      │
      ▼
Is income < 5L?
 ├── YES → Tax = 0
 └── NO
       │
       ▼
Is income < 10L?
 ├── YES → Tax = 20% of income
 └── NO → Tax = 30% of income
```

---

#### ⚠️ 5. **Important Points**

* Use **integer input**, but **tax** should be stored as **double**.
* **Type casting** matters (int × double → double).
* **Avoid commas** in numeric literals (e.g., `500000`, not `5,00,000`).
