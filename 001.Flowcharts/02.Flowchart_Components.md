# #2. 🧱 Flowchart Components – The Building Blocks of Logic

Before creating a flowchart, we must understand the **shapes** or **symbols** used in it. Each shape has a **specific meaning**, just like words in a sentence!

These are **not random drawings** like animals or trees in science books — these are **logical diagram symbols**.

---

## 🧠 Why are Components Important?

✔️ They **standardize** how flowcharts are understood
✔️ They make **complex logic easier** to represent
✔️ Each component has a **unique role** in solving problems visually

# 🔹 1. Terminator Shape – OVAL 🔷

### 📌 Used For:

* **Start** of the process
* **End** (Exit) of the process

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔷 Start
🔷 Exit
```

### ✅ Real Example:

| 🫖 Tea Making      | 🔠 Programming |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| "Start making tea" | Start of code  |
| "Tea is ready!"    | End/Exit point |

---

# 🔸 2. Input/Output Shape – PARALLELOGRAM 🔶

### 📌 Used For:

* **Input** (user enters something)
* **Output** (program gives something back)

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔶 Input: Enter temperature
🔶 Output: Print "Hello"
```

### 🧪 Tea Example:

* 🥄 Input: Add **milk, sugar, tea leaves** (controlled by the user)
* ☕ Output: Final **ready tea**

### 🌍 Real-World Example – Google Search:

| 🧑 User Types          | Google Responds                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Input: `"cat meaning"` | Output: `"a small domesticated animal"` |

# 🟩 3. Process Shape – RECTANGLE ⬛

### 📌 Used For:

* Any **processing step**
* Assigning values
* Performing calculations

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
⬛ A = 10
⬛ Sum = A + B
⬛ Name = "Shraddha"
```

### 🔧 Common Use Cases:

* Assign a value to a variable
* Do calculations (e.g., `total = price * qty`)
* Execute any operation

---

# 💠 4. Decision Shape – DIAMOND 🔷

### 📌 Used For:

* **Conditional Checks**
* Yes/No, True/False decisions
* **Branching** logic

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔷 Is Marks > 33?
     /       \
  Yes         No
 /             \
⬛ Pass        ⬛ Fail
```

### 🌿 Real-Life Analogy:

> Decision = “Branching point of a tree 🌳”
> If condition is **True**, go left.
> If condition is **False**, go right.

---

# ➡️ 5. Arrows – CONNECTORS 🔁

### 📌 Used For:

* Connecting different shapes
* Showing **direction** of logic

### 🖼️ Icon:

```
🔷 Start
  |
⬛ Do Task
  |
🔷 Decision?
 /     \
Yes     No
```

Without arrows, a flowchart becomes confusing. Think of arrows like **Google Maps directions** for your logic. 🗺️

| 🔢 No. | 🧩 Component | 🟦 Shape         | 📘 Used For              | 🧠 Example                 |
| ------ | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1️⃣    | Terminator   | 🔷 Oval          | Start / End              | Start, Exit                |
| 2️⃣    | Input/Output | 🔶 Parallelogram | User input or output     | Enter number, Print result |
| 3️⃣    | Process      | ⬛ Rectangle      | Assignment / Calculation | `A = 5`, `Sum = A + B`     |
| 4️⃣    | Decision     | 💠 Diamond       | Yes/No checks            | `Marks > 33?`              |
| 5️⃣    | Arrow        | ➡️ Arrow         | Direction of flow        | Connect steps              |

# 🧪 Activity: Can You Decode This?

```
🔷 Start
  |
🔶 Input: Enter age
  |
💠 Is age >= 18?
  |         \
Yes         No
  |           \
⬛ Print "Adult"  ⬛ Print "Minor"
  |                |
🔷 Exit        🔷 Exit
```

🔍 **Q:** What’s the purpose of this flowchart?
🧠 **A:** It checks if someone is an adult or a minor based on their age.
