# #6. 🔍 **Problem: Check if a Number is Prime**

## 🧠 **What is a Prime Number?**

A **prime number** is a number **greater than 1** that has **only two divisors**:

1. **1**
2. **Itself**

✅ Examples:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 (only divisible by 1 and themselves)

❌ Not Prime (Composite):
4 (divisible by 1, 2, 4), 6 (1, 2, 3, 6), 9 (1, 3, 9)

# 📊 Flowchart Design (Step-by-Step)

---

### 🔷 Step 1: Start

```
🔷 Start
```

---

### 🔶 Step 2: Input Number `n`

```
🔶 Input n
```

---

### 🟨 Step 3: Initialize a Divider Variable

```
⬛ Let div = 2
```

---

### 🔷 Step 4: Loop Condition (div < n)

```
🔷 Is div < n?
```

* Yes → Go to Step 5
* No → Go to Step 7

---

### 🔷 Step 5: Check Divisibility

```
🔷 Is n % div == 0?
```

* Yes → Print `"Not Prime"` → Exit
* No → div = div + 1 → Back to Step 4

---

### 🔶 Step 6: Output “Not Prime” if divisible

```
🔶 Print "Not Prime"
🔷 Exit
```

---

### 🔶 Step 7: If Loop Finishes without finding any divisor

```
🔶 Print "Prime"
🔷 Exit
```

⬛ Set div = 2
   ↓
🔷 Is div < n?
   |— Yes → 🔷 Is n % div == 0?

## 🧾 Pseudocode

```text
Start
Input n
Let div = 2

While div < n do
    If n % div == 0 then
        Print "Not Prime"
        Exit
    Else
        div = div + 1

Print "Prime"
Exit
```

## ✅ Java Version

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PrimeCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int div = 2;

        while (div < n) {
            if (n % div == 0) {
                System.out.println("Not Prime");
                return;
            }
            div++;
        }

        System.out.println("Prime");
    }
}
```

| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Prime Logic    | Only divisible by 1 and itself            |
| Loop (`while`) | Repeats until `div < n`                   |
| Modulo `%`     | Checks remainder                          |
| `==`           | Equality check in Java                    |
| Early Exit     | As soon as a divisor is found, break loop |

## 🔁 Optimization (Optional Concept)

We can optimize by checking only till `√n`, but for now, sticking to `2 to n-1` keeps it simple and visual-friendly for beginners.

| 🔢 Input | 🔄 Steps                          | 🟢 Output |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| `n = 7`  | 7 % 2 ≠ 0, 7 % 3 ≠ 0, ..., done   | Prime     |
| `n = 9`  | 9 % 2 ≠ 0, 9 % 3 == 0 → Not Prime | Not Prime |
| `n = 13` | 13 % 2, 3, 4, ..., all ≠ 0 → done | Prime     |
