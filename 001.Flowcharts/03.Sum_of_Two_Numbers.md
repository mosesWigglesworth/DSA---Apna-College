> Every flowchart starts here.

---

### 🔶 Step 2: Input A and B (Input)

```
🔶 Input: A, B
```

> The user enters two numbers.

---

### ⬛ Step 3: Calculate the Sum (Process)

```
⬛ Sum = A + B
```

> The program performs the addition.

---

### 🔶 Step 4: Print the Result (Output)

```
🔶 Output: Print Sum
```

> The result is displayed to the user.

---

### 🔷 Step 5: Exit (Terminator)

```
🔷 Exit
```

> The program ends.

## 👨‍💻 Equivalent Pseudocode (English-like fake code)

```text
Start
Input A, B
Sum = A + B
Print Sum
Exit
```

> 🧾 **Pseudocode** is **not a real programming language**, but it helps you **think in code**. You can easily convert it into Java, Python, C++, etc.

---

## 💻 Java-like version:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class SumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int A = sc.nextInt();
        int B = sc.nextInt();
        int Sum = A + B;
        System.out.println(Sum);
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Real-Life Analogy

> Think of it like:

* 🧑 You give two numbers (A and B) to a calculator (Input)
* 🔢 It calculates the result internally (Process)
* 📺 Shows the answer on screen (Output)
